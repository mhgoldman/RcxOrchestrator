== RcxOrchestrator

This proof-of-concept Rails app works with the RCX Agent (https://github.com/mhgoldman/RcxAgent) to execute batches of commands on those agents and collate the output and return codes of those commands. 

RCX Agents can be hardcoded in the app in <tt>app/models/hardcoded_client.rb</tt> for testing only. They can also be loaded in bulk from Skytap or a custom Client class.

This application requires the Sidekiq task queue.
